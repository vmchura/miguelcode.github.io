# Hello world!

This blog will contain the development of a platform to learn, practice, and have fun with the **PySpark** SQL module.
In this first post,
I will talk about
**(a)** myself and my professional experience,
**(b)** the reason why I do choose **PySpark** over Spark, and finally
**(c)** I will also share my reasons why I do strongly believe important to conclude the project.

## I'm Vicc.

I spent many years in college learning complicated math and science subjects.
I loved learning so much during those years, but I became more passionate about computer science.
During the years as a developer of C#, Scala, Python, etc.
I have completed interesting projects,
but I have also made many mistakes,
and if I may be confidential, each mistake has hurt me a lot.
Luckily for me, I was surrounded by people who taught me that being wrong is not bad.
What is bad is not helping to solve the mistake.

## PySpark.SQL

I have been working with PySpark for years,
and I have noticed that my colleagues and I cannot accompany our learning of PySpark with various exercises to remember all the functions.
This is how the inspiration was born to imitate platforms like [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com) but oriented to PySpark,
and I want to share this development in a sequence of posts.

Spark certainly has advantages over PySpark from a technical standpoint,
but for a developer who is more into tools like Pandas and Python will find it easier to adapt to PySpark.

## Train, train!

The conclusion with this project will be very useful for all the people who need to start,
reinforce and consolidate their knowledge with the SQL functions of PySpark.

I invite you to follow and contribute to this blog,
where I will develop a platform to learn, practice and have fun with SQL PySpark.
